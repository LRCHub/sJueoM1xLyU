[00:58.87] It's close to midnight
[01:01.35] Something evil's lurkin' in the dark
[01:19.35] 
[01:06.90] Under the moonlight
[01:09.44] You see a sight that almost stops your heart
[01:12.84] You try to scream
[01:15.46] But terror takes the sound before you make it
[01:37.96] 
[01:20.99] You start to freeze
[01:23.78] As horror looks you right between the eyes
[01:26.70] You're paralyzed
[01:29.19] 'Cause this is thriller
[01:40.69] 
[01:31.92] Thriller night
[01:33.84] And no one's gonna save you
[01:35.81] From the beast about to strike
[01:37.69] You know it's thriller
[01:40.13] Thriller night
[01:42.30] You're fighting for your life
[01:43.76] Inside a killer, thriller tonight, yeah
[02:03.26] 
[01:55.58] You hear the door slam
[01:58.37] And realize there's nowhere left to run
[02:17.87] 
[02:03.79] You feel the cold hand
[02:06.64] And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
[02:10.00] You close your eyes
[02:12.61] And hope that this is just imagination, girl
[02:18.19] But all the while
[02:20.51] You hear a creature creepin' up behind
[02:23.73] You're out of time
[02:26.00] 'Cause this is thriller
[02:37.50] 
[02:28.83] Thriller night
[02:30.85] There ain't no second chance
[02:32.40] Against the thing with the forty eyes, girl
[02:35.33] (Thriller, thriller night)
[02:38.82] You're fighting for your life
[02:40.55] Inside a killer, thriller tonight
[02:45.42] Night creatures callin'
[02:47.06] The dead start to walk in their masquerade
[03:08.06] 
[02:53.00] There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
[02:58.29] (They're open wide)
[02:59.55] This is the end of your life
[03:13.55] 
[03:06.58] They're out to get you
[03:09.29] There's demons closing in on every side
[03:28.79] 
[03:14.65] They will possess you
[03:17.14] Unless you change that number on your dial
[03:20.84] Now is the time
[03:23.34] For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
[03:28.94] All through the night
[03:31.48] I'll save you from the terror on the screen
[03:34.74] I'll make you see
[03:36.81] That this is thriller
[03:39.67] Thriller night
[03:41.52] 'Cause I can thrill you more
[03:43.22] Than any ghoul would ever dare try
[03:45.94] (Thriller, thriller night)

[04:21.63] 
[04:21.16] I'm gonna thrill you tonight
[04:24.12] Darkness falls across the land
[04:39.12] 
[04:27.35] The midnight hour is close at hand
[04:31.15] Creatures crawl in search of blood
[04:35.08] To terrorize y'alls neighborhood
[04:51.08] 
[04:38.88] And whosoever shall be found
[04:42.06] Without the soul for getting down
[04:45.87] Must stand and face the hounds of hell
[04:49.96] And rot inside a corpse's shell
[04:54.23] I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller)
[04:56.71] Ooh babe
[04:58.65] (Thriller) I'm gonna thrill you tonight
[05:00.14] (Thriller) Oh darling
[05:01.49] (Oh babe) I'm gonna thrill you tonight
[05:03.35] (Thriller) Ooh, babe
[05:05.09] (Thriller at night, babe) I'm gonna thrill you tonight
[05:08.02] (Thriller) Oh darling
[05:09.58] (Oh babe) Thriller at night, babe
[05:12.53] (Thriller at night, babe)
[05:14.28] The foulest stench is in the air
[05:17.05] The funk of forty thousand years
[05:19.54] And grisly ghouls from every tomb
[05:23.28] Are closing in to seal your doom
[05:39.28] 
[05:27.97] And though you fight to stay alive
[05:31.35] Your body starts to shiver
[05:44.35] 
[05:35.16] For no mere mortal can resist
[05:39.06] The evil of the thriller
