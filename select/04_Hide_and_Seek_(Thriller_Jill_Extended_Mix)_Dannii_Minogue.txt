Feeling the ride, don't wanna run away, baby don't hide
Seek and you'll find, when I close my eyes
We're counting the moments so come with me now
Let's go outside
Falling down like rain, falling down like rain

Hide and seek, hide and seek, hide and seek, hide and seek
Hide and seek, hide and seek, hide and seek, hide

A twist in my mind whenever you call my name, come for me now
I don't wanna hide, the taste of your love
Is sweeter than ever, now come and taste mine
Seek and you'll find
Falling down like rain, falling down like rain

Hide and seek, hide and seek, hide and seek, hide and seek
Hide and seek, hide and seek, hide and seek, hide

Feeling the ride, a twist in my mind, the taste of your love
Come and taste mine, seek and you'll find
Falling down like rain, falling down like rain
Falling down like rain

Hide and seek, hide and seek, hide and seek, hide and seek
Hide and seek, hide and seek, hide and seek, hide
Hide and seek, hide and seek, hide and seek, hide and seek
Hide and seek, hide and seek, hide and seek, hide
Hide and seek, hide and seek, hide and seek, hide and seek
Hide and seek, hide and seek, hide and seek, hide
